An automated eBay HTML listing generator that works like this:

Input: The user pastes Argos.co.uk and 1 more website product URLs into a spreadsheet (product-urls.xlsx)
Process: They save the spreadsheet and run EbayListingGenerator.exe
Output: The tool generates HTML files for each product URL, ready for eBay listings

What the scraper needs to extract from each Argos product page:

Product title (e.g. "Argos Home Seville 5 Drawer Chest – Anthracite")
Product image URLs
Product description

The generated HTML should match a pre-existing template the client already has (from a previously provided sample).
Project constraints:

Deadline: 6am, February 13th
Budget: $50 AUD
If 5 URLs are entered → 5 HTML files are produced

Essentially, it's a bulk eBay listing creator that scrapes Argos product data and 1 more website and injects it into a fixed HTML template automatically.
